# List of resources required to run a typical website

The power of the server, and therefore its price, depend on the tasks it must perform. In my calculations, I take a server for a site with regular daily visits, but with small loads on the server itself.
***

* Server 2 pcs. 25000 * 2                                      _50000 UAH_
* Switch L3 2 pcs. 2200 * 2                                    _4400 UAH_
* Router 2 pcs. 3500 * 2                                       _7000 UAH_
* wires, adapters, plugs, cables                               _3000 UAH_

---

* GPON Internet 2 providers
    * one-time connection costs - UAH 1,000 * 2                 _2000 UAH_
    * expenses every month UAH 200 * 2 = UAH 400/month *12      _4800 UAH_
* White ip
    * one-time costs for connection -                           _60 UAH_
    * expenses every month UAH 60/month *                       _12720 UAH_
* Domain
    * one-time expenses / per year 500 hryvnias                 _500 UAH_
    * SSL certificate
    one-time/yearly expenses (Comodo Instant SSL)               _1800 UAH_

* Uninterruptible power supply 
(for power until the generator is turned on)
    * one-time                                                  _20000 UAH_
* Generator (for power when there is no light)
    * one time                                                  _30000 UAH_
    * gasoline - consumption 1 l/h, I will not take our option
    blackout, I'll just take 5% from of working time 
    (365*24)*5% = 438 hours * 50 UAH                            _21900 UAH_

---
* Support and service
I will invest 2 hours a month for support
2 * 12 = 24 hours with a price of 500 UAH/hour                  _12000 UAH_
* Electricity
It is difficult to calculate, 
I will accept UAH 500/month * 12                                _6000 UAH_
* Rooms
rent of additional space for a server room
I will accept 4,000 UAH/month * 12                              _48000 UAH_

* Servers 2 pcs E2ads_v5 2*4300 UAH/month * 12                  _51600 UAH_
* White IP (for load balancer)                                  _1260 UAH_
* Additional disk for data 6000 UAH/month *12                   _72000 UAH_

* Domain

* SSL certificate
one-time/yearly expenses (Comodo Instant SSL)                   _1800 UAH_

* Support and service
I assume that 1 hour per month is needed for the solution
problems and optimization or customization of the site
12 hours * 500 UAH                                              _6000 UAH_


> The amount of costs for installation and uninterrupted support of the server/site for a period of 1 year in the Microsoft Azure cloud ___133,160 UAH___

> * In the example, I took the static sizes of Virtual Machines and additional data disk for the convenience of calculations, but they can be made dynamic, which will increase in case of loads during peak hours, and decrease when the number of visitors decreases. In my opinion, a dynamic system will reduce server costs by at least half, if not more.

> ___Conclusion:___ Based on the calculations, we can conclude that deploying a website in a cloud service is a more financially profitable and reliable solution than deploying a physical server on your own.
